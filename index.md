## Feel free to interrupt and ask questions!

---

- Your questions are more important than anything I have to say.
- If you have a question, other people probably have it too.

---

Bitcoin is a currency.

---

You can save it, you can spend it.

---

Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto.

---

Satoshi disappeared, but bitcoin keeps working just fine.

---

With bitcoin, there is nobody standing between you and your money.

---

If you have dollars in a back, you don't have control of those dollars.

---

You must ask the bank to give you the dollars back, or to send them to someone else.

---

Bitcoin doesn't work that way. If you have bitcoin, you can save it or send it to someone else. You don't need to ask permission and nobody can stop you.

---

Bitcoin cannot be inflated.

---

What is inflation? What backs the US dollar?

---

Inflation is when the number of dollars goes up, and each dollar buys less.

What is the price of a candy bar?

---

When I was a kid, it was 50Â¢.

---

Bitcoin's current inflation is 1.72% per year, and will go down to 0.2% per year by 2033.

---

The dollar is currently inflating at 9% per year, and is **designed** to inflate by at least 2% per year, forever.

---

Inflation benefits people with assets, like houses, stocks, and businesses.

---

They are protected from inflation, because their assets retain their value when more dollars are printed.

---

Inflation hurts people who don't have assets. If you make $15 an hour, next year, those $15 will buy less than they did the year before.

---

If you want to buy a house, that house will cost more and more dollars as dollars become less and less valuable due to inflation.

---

Bitcoin is software.

---

It runs on computers, like this one.

---

This computer is connected to many other computers running the same software.

---

Together, they are the Bitcoin network, which processes Bitcoin transactions.

---

What is a transaction?

---

A transaction is someone sending bitcoin to someone else.

---

All the computers in the network together make sure that the owner of the bitcoin authorized the transaction.

---

Miners collect transactions together and publish them as blocks, which are really just big groups of transactions.

One bitcoin is currently worth $23,000, but you can buy part of a bitcoin, for example $10 worth.

---
